Spiceworks schedule.


Stage 1. Learn JS programming. (in progress)
I want to finish this stage within 10 days.

The above picture is my road map to learn JS. Before writing the Spiceworks plugin, 
I must understand how to control html DOM via both raw Javascript and JQuery. 

This my learning progress so far:
    Day 1, April 28th 
    Learn the basic JS syntax and functions 

    Day 2, May 2nd
    Finish reading the part of Javascript functions and start to learn Javascript objects.
    
    Day 3, today
    Continue learning the JS objects, expecially the regular expression in JS.

Stage 2. Write the plugin. (not start)
I'm going to start writing plugin when I have learnt the JQuery events part (blue line in the picture).
