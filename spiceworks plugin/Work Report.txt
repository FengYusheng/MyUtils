This is the work report about Spiceworks' plugin for April 26th to April 27th

Current state and achievements:
1. Wang Xiao has built a temporary Spiceworks on a virtural machine as my test environment;
2. I have read the plugin tutorials and figure out what we are going to do:

We need to write code to control the display of "Spiceworks' User Portal" page. 
In other words, we need implement the callback function:
"SPICEWORKS.portalv2.ready( callback )"

Current problem:
The plugin is written in Javascipt. And unfortunately I'm unfamiliar with it. I have to take serval days to 
learn it.

I have found two JS tutorials:
