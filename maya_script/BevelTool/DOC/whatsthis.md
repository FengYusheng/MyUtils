## soft edges definition
An edge is the place where two different colors, textures or values
meet. Edges may be characterized in a variety of ways. Soft edges blend
together, making it difficult to distinguish where texture/color/value
stops and another begins.

The higher the crease value, the sharper the crease.

Maya offers two methods to crease edges and vertices on a polygon mesh:
1. The Crease Tool.

    `polyCrease`

2. The Crease Set Editor.

*You must select one method to use throughout your workflow, as the methods can't
be used interchangeably on the same components.*
